Squid and Proxy ---- (Default port is 3128)
#############################################	
	it generally installed on a seperate server. It works by tracking objects use over the network.
	squid acts as intermediary, simply passing the clients request on the server and saving a copy of
	requested objects, if the same client or multiple clients request the same object before it expires from 
	squid's cache.
	it accelerate the download & save bandwidth.

Installation :-
###############
	$ sudo apt-get install squid -y
	$ sudo service squid start

Configuration file :-
#####################
	$ vim /etc/squid/squid.conf


If we want to make changes then we have to write that changes in configuration file..

Examples:-
#########
	1.Block Websites from particular Ip
		> acl sunny src 192.168.1.0         (Here, sunny is username and 192.168.1.0 is own Ip)		
		> acl blocked_website dstdomain .facebook.com .twitter.com   (Here, blocked website is just a name) 
		> http_access deny blocked_website

	** If we want to allow that particular user for particular website than just make it allow 

	2.Block particular site to particular website
		>> just write the one url to "acl blocked_website dstdomain .facebook.com"

	3.Block Many IPs of same network to one website 
		>>  acl sunny src 192.168.1.0/24
		>>  acl blocked_website dstdomain .twitter.com
		>>  http_access deny blocked_website


	4.Many Users
	______________
	acl sunny 192.168.1.0 
	http_access deny .yahoo.com all !sunny !sunny1     (Here sunny and sunny1 are users which are seperated by !)


>>>if we want to include a file then we use include keyword
include <filename>
>>>Another keyword is Parameter
acl whitelist dstdomain parameters("PATTH of FILE")


***Timing Constraint****

acl networks src 192.168.1.0/24
acl time MTWHF 16:00-8:00     (these website accessible only from 18:00 to 08:00)
htpp_access allow .facebook time allow networks
